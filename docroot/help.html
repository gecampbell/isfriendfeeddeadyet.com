	<h1>Is FriendFeed dead yet?</h1>
	<h3>How this works</h3>
	<p>This site verifies that <a href="http://friendfeed.com">FriendFeed</a>
	is up and operational and producing valid content. It analyzes the HTTP
	response status code as well as the size of the returned page to determine
	if FriendFeed is alive or not.
	Using our patent-pending "death checker" algorithm, we can
	determine with a high degree of accuracy whether or not the
	two people still using FriendFeed are going to be inconvenienced.
	</p>
	<h3>What else can you do with it?</h3>
	<p>You can also verify whether or not a particular FriendFeed user
	is still alive:</p>
	<p><code>http://isfriendfeeddeadyet.com/<i>username</i></code></p>
	<p>For example, to check to see if my account is still alive:</p>
	<p><code><a href="http://isfriendfeeddeadyet.com/glenc">http://isfriendfeeddeadyet.com/glenc</a></code></p>
	<p>If you have any further questions or comments, feel free to leave me
	a message at
	<a href="http://friendfeed.com/glenc">my FriendFeed account</a>.
	Unless it's dead, of course.</p>
	<h3>Credits</h3>
	<p>This site was written by Glen Campbell. However, it was especially inspired
	by Robert Scoble and the hordes of his minions who have falsely proclaimed
	the early death of FriendFeed. While all good things come to an end, it
	hasn't happened yet.</p>
	<p>If you're really interested in FriendFeed, you should
	check out the weekly <a href="http://www.ffundercats.com/">FFundercats</a> podcast
	by, for, and about FriendFeeders&mdash;a bit shout out
	to Johnny Worthington and Josh Haley. This really isn't a plain
	unvarnished attempt to get invited onto their show, but an open
	statement of devotion. Also, theirs is the single greatest podcast
	that has ever been created in the whole universe.</p>
